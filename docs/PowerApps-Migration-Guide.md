# Petromaint Project Management Platform - Power Apps Migration Guide

## ðŸš€ Complete Implementation Plan with Copilot

### Phase 1: Data Preparation (30 minutes)

#### Step 1: Export Project Data
```typescript
// Use the provided projectData.ts to export Excel file
import { mockProjectData, exportToExcel } from '../src/data/projectData.ts';

const excelData = exportToExcel(mockProjectData);
```

#### Step 2: Upload to SharePoint/OneDrive
1. Create new Excel file: `Petromaint_Projects.xlsx`
2. Add all columns from `powerAppsColumnMapping`
3. Import the 37 projects from your dataset
4. Save to SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business

### Phase 2: Power Apps Creation with Copilot (2-3 hours)

#### Initial App Creation
**Copilot Prompt:**
```
Create a comprehensive project management app for construction/oil & gas projects with:
- Dashboard showing KPIs (total projects, contract value, at-risk projects)
- Project manager performance overview with drill-down capability
- Location-based project view (Egypt regions: Nile Delta, etc.)
- Client portfolio management
- Individual project tracking with progress bars and financial metrics
- Data entry forms for new projects
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Risk assessment indicators
- Mobile-responsive design with Petromaint branding (red #DC2626, blue #004A80, yellow #FFC107)
```

#### Screen Structure Creation
**Copilot Prompt for Navigation:**
```
Create a hierarchical navigation system with breadcrumbs:
1. Portfolio Overview (main dashboard)
2. Project Manager View â†’ Location View â†’ Client View â†’ Project View â†’ Project Details
3. Add back navigation and breadcrumb trail
4. Include search bar in header and role indicator badge
```

### Phase 3: Screen-by-Screen Implementation

#### 1. Dashboard Screen (Main KPIs)
**Copilot Prompt:**
```
Create dashboard cards showing:
- Total Projects: 37
- Active Projects: 25  
- Total Contract Value: 45M EGP
- Average Completion: 85%
- At-Risk Projects: 3
Add trending indicators and color coding (green for good, red for risk)
```

**Power Apps Formula Examples:**
```powerquery
// Total Projects Count
CountRows(Projects)

// At-Risk Projects
CountIf(Projects, 'Risk Level' = "High Risk")

// Average Completion Rate
Average(Projects, 'Schedule Progress (%)')

// Total Contract Value
Sum(Projects, 'Contract Value (EGP)')
```

#### 2. Project Manager Gallery
**Copilot Prompt:**
```
Create a gallery showing project managers with:
- Manager name and photo placeholder
- Total projects assigned
- Active projects count
- Completion rate percentage with progress bar
- Performance status badge (Excellent >90%, Good 80-90%, Needs Attention <80%)
- Click to drill down to their locations
```

**Power Apps Gallery Formula:**
```powerquery
// Group by Project Manager
GroupBy(Projects, "Project Manager", "ManagerProjects")

// Calculate metrics per manager
AddColumns(
    ManagerProjects,
    "TotalProjects", CountRows(ManagerProjects),
    "ActiveProjects", CountIf(ManagerProjects, 'Execution Status' = "In progress"),
    "CompletionRate", Average(ManagerProjects, 'Schedule Progress (%)')
)
```

#### 3. Location View
**Copilot Prompt:**
```
Create location-based view for selected project manager showing:
- Egyptian regions (Nile Delta, Cairo, Alexandria, etc.)
- Project count per location
- Regional performance metrics
- Map visualization placeholder
- Status indicators per region
```

#### 4. Client Portfolio View
**Copilot Prompt:**
```
Display clients for selected location showing:
- Company logos/placeholders
- Company names (BURULLUS GAS CO., Abu Qir Petroleum Co., etc.)
- Project count and total value per client
- Relationship status indicator
- Recent activity timeline
```

#### 5. Project List View
**Copilot Prompt:**
```
Create comprehensive project table with:
- Sortable columns (Name, Status, Progress, Value, Risk)
- Search and filter functionality
- Progress bars for completion
- Status badges with color coding
- Financial metrics display
- Risk level indicators
- Action buttons (View Details, Edit, Generate Report)
```

**Power Apps Filter Formulas:**
```powerquery
// Search functionality
Search(Projects, SearchInput.Text, "Project Name", "Company Name")

// Status filter
If(StatusFilter.Selected.Value = "All", 
    Projects, 
    Filter(Projects, 'Execution Status' = StatusFilter.Selected.Value))

// Risk filter
Filter(Projects, 'Risk Level' = RiskFilter.Selected.Value)
```

#### 6. Project Details Screen
**Copilot Prompt:**
```
Create detailed project view showing:
- Project header with key metrics
- Timeline visualization with milestones
- Financial dashboard (contract value, actual vs planned revenue)
- Progress tracking with phases
- Risk assessment section
- Document attachments area
- Action buttons (Update Status, Add Note, Generate Report)
```

#### 7. Data Entry Form

- Currency formatting for financial fields
- File upload capability
- Save/Submit/Cancel buttons
- Success/error notifications
```

### Phase 4: Branding & Polish (1-2 hours)
